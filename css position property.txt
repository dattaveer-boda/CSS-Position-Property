Default value of position is static.

positioning html element with absolute value(having top:0, left:0), will float the element to the top most left of the root element.
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <header>Header</header>
    <nav>Nav</nav>
    <footer>Footer</footer>
    <div class="box-pink"></div>
  </body>
</html>

nav {
  background:blue;
  margin-bottom:5px;
  position: absolute;
  top:0px;
  left:0px;
}

in the above case, nav element will stick to html element because it's positioned abosolute and top and left are 0.

body {
        padding:10px;
        width:100%;
        height:100%;
        background: orange;
        border:1px solid black;
        position:absolute;
}

if we update immediate parent of nav, i.e. body to position absolute, then nav will stick to body tag.
.i.e current DOM node and it's parent node are absolute then current node will take it's parent node as base.

.box-pink {
        position: relative;
        background: pink;
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        top: 100px;      
        left: 100px;
      }

position relative, takes the left,top,right bottom properties value from its current or actual position of DOM.

If we take above example, it will go 100px down and 100px right to the current position where it exists currently.

z-index property works only if the position of DOM node is a non static value.

position fixed are directly aligned to html element, they dont get affected by scrolling,
they are just fixed at particular position of page with given values.

position sticky is initially relative later after scrolling it becomes fixed.
